# Webstorm Darcula Plus Theme

Classic Webstorm Darcula Theme with small enhancements.

- The theme is based on https://github.com/imekachi/webstorm-darcula/blob/master/themes/darcula-2022.json.
- Small adjustments have been added to get it even closer to the original Darcula theme (e.g., some markdown adjustments and highlighting custom JSX tags differently than native HTML tags).
- Small enhancements have been added for features that were not highlighted in Webstorm (like types and interfaces, or the enclosing tags for interpolations in template literals).
